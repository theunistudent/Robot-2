## Function call for move c
Definition [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = movec(via_point,pose_to,jointOrPose,a,v,r,mode)
Circular Move: Move to position (circular in tool-space)TCP moves on the circular arc segment from current pose, through pose_via to pose_to. Accelerates to and moves with constant tool speed v. Use the mode parameter to define the orientationinterpolation.

PARAMETERS:

*pose_via* = path point (note: only position is used). Pose_via can also be specified as joint positions, then forward kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding pose.

*pose_to* = arget pose (note: only position is used in Fixed orientation mode). Pose_to can also be specified as joint positions, then forward kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding pose.

*jointOrPose*= "joint" or "pose" to provide joint inputs or poseinputs

*a* = tool acceleration (m/s^2) (default = 1.2)

*v* = tool speed (m/s) (default = 0.25)

*r* = blend radius (of target pose) (m) (default = 0.05)

*mode* = (mode default = 1)
        0: Unconstrained mode. Interpolate orientation from current pose to target pose (pose_to)  1: Fixed mode. Keep orientation constant relative to the tangent of the circular arc(starting from current pose) 



 ## Function call for move j
 Definition: [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = movej(target,jointOrPose,a,v,t,r)
 Move to position (linear in joint-space)  When using this command, the robot must be at a standstill or comefrom a movej or movel with a blend. The speed and acceleration parameters control the trapezoid speed profile of the move. Alternatively, the t parameter can be used to set the time for this move. Time setting has priority over speed and acceleration settings

 PARAMETERS:

 *target*: Joint positions or pose. If pose is given then inverse kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding joint positions
 
 *jointOrPose*= "joint" or "pose" to provide joint inputs or pose inputs
 
 *a* = joint acceleration of the leading axis (rad/s^2) (default = 1.4)
 
 *v* = joint speed of the leading axis (rad/s)(default = 1.05)
 
 *t* = time (s) (default = 0). If it were specified the command would ignore the a and v values
 
 *r* = blend radius (m) (default = 0). If blend radius is set, the robot arm trajectory will be modified to avoid the robot stopping at the point

## Function call for movel
 Definition: [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = movel(target,a,v,t,r)
 Move to position (linear in tool-space)

 PARAMETERS:

 *target*: Target pose (pose can also be specified as joint positions, then forward kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding pose)
 
 *a* = joint acceleration of the leading axis (m/s^2) (default = 1.2)
 
 *jointOrPose*= "joint" or "pose" to provide joint inputs or pose inputs
 
 *v* = joint speed of the leading axis (m/s)(default = 0.25)
 
 *t* = time (s) (default = 0). If it were specified the command would ignore the a and v values
 
 *r* = blend radius (m) (default = 0). If blend radius is set, the robot arm trajectory will be modified to avoid the robot stopping at the point

## Function call for move p
 Definition: [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = movep(obj,target,jointOrPose,a,v,r)
 Move Process
 Blend circular (in tool-space) and move linear (in tool-space) to position. Accelerates to and moves with constant tool speed v.
 
 PARAMETERS
 
 *target* = target pose (pose can also be specified as joint positions, then forward kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding pose)
 
 *a* = tool acceleration (m/s^2) (default = 1.2)

 *r* = blend radius (m) (default = 0)

## Function call for speedl
Definition: [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = speedl(obj,tool_speed,acceleration,time,aRot)
Tool Speed
Accelerate linearly in Cartesian space and continue with constant tool  speed. The time t is optional; if provided the function will return after time t, regardless of the target speed has been reached. If the time t is not provided, the function will return when the target speed is reached.
PARAMETERS
*tool_speed* = (m/s) spatial vector
*acceleration* = tool position acceleration(m/s^2) 
t: time [s] before function returns (optional)
aRot: tool acceleration [rad/s^2] (optional), if not defined
a, position acceleration, is used

## Function call for speedj
Definition: [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = speedj(obj,joint_speeds,acceleration,time)
Joint speed
Accelerate linearly in joint space and continue with constant joint speed. The time t is optional; if provided the function will return after time t, regardless of the target speed has been reached. If the time t is not provided, the function will return when the target speed is reached.
PARAMETERS
*joint_speeds* = (rad/s) joint speeds
*acceleration* = joint acceleration(rad/s^2) 
t: time [s] before function returns (optional)
