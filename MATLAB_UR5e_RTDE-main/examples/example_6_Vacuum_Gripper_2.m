%% ----- EXAMPLE 6: Vacuum Gripper 2 -----
% A simple program combining the RTDE toolbox with the Vacuum gripper
% toolbox.

% WORKING WITH THE REAL UR5e TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE

% You can also pass in values for accleration, velocity

% Turn on vacuum gripper

% use the default values!

% Release Vacuum gripper

% You can combine all of the poses like this
poses = [poses1;poses2;poses3;poses4;poses5;poses6;poses7;];
% and plot the path of the TCP
rtde.drawPath(poses);


% Closing the TCP Connection
