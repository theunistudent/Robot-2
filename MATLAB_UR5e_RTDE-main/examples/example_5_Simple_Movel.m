% Definition: [poses,joints,jointVelocities,jointAccelerations,torques] = movel(target,jointOrPose,a,v,t,r)
% Move to position (linear in tool-space)
% PARAMETERS:
% *target*: Target pose (pose can also be specified as joint positions, then forward
% kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding pose)
% *a* = joint acceleration of the leading axis (default = 1.2)
% *jointOrPose*= "joint" or "pose" to provide joint inputs or pose
% inputs
% *v* = joint speed of the leading axis (default = 0.25)
% *t* = time (s) (default = 0). If it were specified the command would ignore
% the a and v values
% *r* = blend radius (m) (default = 0). If blend radius is set, the robot arm trajectory
% will be modified to avoid the robot stopping at the point

% Play around with these values and see what you observe!
% What happens when you set a large/small r value?

% What happens when you set a t value?
% What happens when acceleration is large but the velocity is small?
% What happens when the velocity is large but the acceleration is small?

% parameters that you have set!

% movej can be called just by providing only the target pose

% You can also pass in values for accleration, velocity

% REMEMBER: You do not need to provide any a,v,t or r values at all if you wish to
% use the default values!

% You can combine all of the poses like this
